# Test Coverage Summary - MCP Todo Server

## Overall Status
- **Estimated Overall Coverage**: ~68-70% (based on available data)
- **Target Coverage**: 80%+

## Package Coverage Breakdown

### High Coverage (80%+)
- `internal/domain`: **100.0%** ✅
- `internal/infrastructure/factory`: **100.0%** ✅
- `internal/logging`: **100.0%** ✅
- `internal/validation`: **100.0%** ✅
- `internal/application`: **91.7%** ✅
- `internal/errors`: **90.9%** ✅
- `internal/lock`: **90.5%** ✅ (tests failing)
- `internal/infrastructure/adapters`: **89.5%** ✅
- `internal/infrastructure/persistence/filesystem`: **85.2%** ✅ (tests failing)
- `utils`: **80.3%** ✅

### Medium Coverage (50-79%)
- `internal/search`: **77.9%** ↑ (improved from 69.5%)
- `handlers`: **77.2%** (tests failing)
- `server`: **53.4%** ↑ (improved from 40.6%)

### Low Coverage (<50%)
- `internal/testutil`: **35.2%** (tests failing)
- `main`: **0.0%**
- `core`: No coverage data (tests failing)

## Recent Improvements (Phase 1)
- **Server package**: 40.6% → 53.4% (+12.8%)
- **Search package**: 69.5% → 77.9% (+8.4%)

## Test Health Issues
Several packages have failing tests that need attention:
- `handlers` - 77.2% coverage but tests failing
- `internal/infrastructure/persistence/filesystem` - 85.2% coverage but tests failing
- `internal/lock` - 90.5% coverage but tests failing
- `internal/testutil` - 35.2% coverage and tests failing
- `core` - Tests failing, no coverage data

## Next Steps to Reach 80%+ Overall
1. Fix failing tests in high-coverage packages (handlers, filesystem, lock)
2. Improve server package to 70%+ (currently 53.4%)
3. Add basic tests for main package
4. Fix core package tests to get coverage data
5. Consider improving testutil package (currently 35.2%)

## Critical Path to 80%
Focus on these for maximum impact:
1. **Fix failing tests** - This alone will ensure ~77% coverage is properly counted
2. **Server package** - Increase from 53.4% to 70%+ would add significant overall coverage
3. **Main package** - Even basic tests would help (currently 0%)
